Luftikus is a digital adaption to an analog EQ with fixed half-octave bands and additional high frequency boost. As an improvement to the hardware it allows deeper cuts and supports a keep-gain mode where overall gain changes are avoided.

# Features #

## Bands and Shelves ##

Luftikus has half-octave bands at 10, 40, 160 and 640 Hz, completed by a high shelf at 2.5 kHz. For adding _sparkle_ to recordings a further high frequency boost at 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 kHz can be used.
The overall design was improved to allow deeper cuts. The range -5 to +10 is the original range while below -5 results in cuts unavailable in hardware.

## Modes ##

The hardware adds overall gain which can lead to clipping. To counter this an output trim as well as the "Keep Gain" mode is available. While the trim allows manual adjustments the "Keep Gain" mode will keep (more or less) the overall loudness by reducing gain in non-boosted areas.

The "Analog" mode models a more analog behavior while in "Mastering" the controls become stepped and the "Analog" mode performs better.
